Q Give an example where call apply bind is required?
    call() - you can tie a function into an object as if it belonged to the object
        function_name.call(object_name, argument 1, argument 2)       ==> function can use this.key_name to access the object.

    apply() - same as call, but argument taken as array
        function_name.apply(object_name, [argument 1, argument 2] )

    bind() - instead of executing the function, bind returns the function, which can be called to get the value;
        const return_function = function_name.apply(object_name, [argument 1, argument 2] )
        return_function()

Q Write a program to check two objects are equal ( deep equal )
        if (obj1Length === obj2Length) {
                    return Object.keys(obj1).every(
                        key => obj2.hasOwnProperty(key)
                            && obj2[key] === obj1[key]);
                }
                return false;
